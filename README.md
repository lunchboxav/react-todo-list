Basic todo-list example using React

## Installation
This doesn't come with any node modules, so first go to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`

## Run Application
Run `npm run build` to build the JSX file. It'll available in `dist/App.js`. 
Finally, open the `index.html` to see the result. It doesn't come with any server whatsoever.
